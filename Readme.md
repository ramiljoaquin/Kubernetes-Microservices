Build scalable and reliable microservices with Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a popular DevOps tool for managing containers at scale. Microservices allow developers to deploy individual app components, enabling continuous integration and increased fault tolerance. This course teaches how these technologies combineâ€”culminating in a real-world microservices application hosted in a Kubernetes environment. Instructor Karthik Gaekwad describes the benefits of microservices and shows how they can be implemented inside the container-based architecture paradigm. Using an existing monolithic application, he breaks down its functionality, adds Kubernetes constructs, and deploys the new services into a Kubernetes environment with Minikube. Finally, Karthik introduces tools such as Helm and Jaeger, which are used along with Kubernetes to build more resilient microservices.
